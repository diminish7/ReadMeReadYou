Chapter 20
         The climbers disperse in ones and twos, fading into the falling snow as they return to their tents. The specter watches, hidden in the storm, thick snowflakes passing through his insubstantial body.
     It’s done, he thinks.
         He thought he’d feel different. All these years--these generations--of waiting and planning, and it’s finally happened. All twelve in one place. And now he’s free, just like any other dead man.
         But that’s not true. Not like any other.
         He’s watched all day as the dead left their bodies, wisped away like snow in the wind, powerless to do anything but submit to life and death. That’s not him. He has a choice.
         He watches one climber in particular walking away from the group. He feels the hostility rippling off the man in hot waves, senses the darkness in the man’s mind. So predictable.
         Following after the angry man, the specter smiles. He feels a warmth where his heart would be if he were still alive.
     I have a choice.
